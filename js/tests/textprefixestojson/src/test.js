Thus, I wanted to say I'm sorry about doing so. I don't expect a response, as I accept your previous reply. This is just to help me move on. My unit testing is coming along well. I have people in Norman, OK to help me, but also in Edmond and Oklahoma City. There are things like a game app that I'm working on with a Senior developer involving Jasmine as well as a FreeCodeCamp Angular App that is sponsored by Techlahoma (howdy Amanda and Jesse). It looks like I have a lot of resources and opportunity.")})(Brent);
